# OMSIMap Launcher
This is a repository for people they would like there own launcher for their OMSI2 Map. This repository offers the default code by AkEgo (me) with Tutorial to modify it.

An default knowlegde of Java is practical but not recommended!
[Have a look into the Wiki of this Repository](https://github.com/EgoLeX/OMSIMap_Launcher/wiki) to know how to modify this Launcher (available in English and German).
